                In 1986 the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Army Research Office (ARO), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and ESL, Inc sponsored Berkeley POSTGRES Project which was led by Michael Stonebrakessr. In 1987 the first demo version of the project is released. In June 1989, Version 1 was released to some external users. Version 2 and 3 were released in 1990 and 1991. Version 3 had support for multiple storage managers, an query executor was improved, rule system was rewritten. After that, POSTGRES has been started to be implemented in various research and development projects. For example, in late 1992, POSTGRES became the primary data manager for the Sequoia 2000 scientific computing project4. User community around the project also has been started increasing; by 1993, it was doubled.
